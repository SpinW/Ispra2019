# BasicPresentation

This is the first attempt at making a presentation using reveal.js and a template base.

## Installation

`master.html` and `slides.html` should be copied from the `presentation_base` directory into the root directory and  `master.html` renamed to `index.html`.

## Using

Slides are in `slides.html` and can be modified accordingly (duh!). 

## For publishing

This can be published by creating a gh-pages branch and will be served at `www.spinw.org/BasicPresentation`. An accompanying post should be created in the `spinw.github.io` repo under `pages/_presentations` so it is automaticall published from the main site.
